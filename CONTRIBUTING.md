## üèóÔ∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Google Cloud account (for testing)

### Setting up the development environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vertex-ai-imagen-mcp.git
   cd vertex-ai-imagen-mcp
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. **Set up pre-commit hooks** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables for testing**
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-test-project"
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/test-key.json"
   export VERTEX_AI_LOCATION="us-central1"
   ```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run tests with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_api.py

# Run tests in verbose mode
python -m pytest -v
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for any new functionality
- Ensure tests cover both success and failure cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external API calls to avoid charges during testing

Example test structure:
```python
def test_generate_image_success():
    """Test successful image generation."""
    # Test implementation
    pass

def test_generate_image_invalid_prompt():
    """Test error handling for invalid prompts."""
    # Test implementation
    pass
```

## üìù Code Style

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with some modifications:

- **Line length**: 88 characters (Black default)
- **String quotes**: Use double quotes for strings
- **Import ordering**: Use `isort` for consistent import ordering

### Formatting Tools

```bash
# Format code with Black
black src/ tests/ examples/

# Sort imports with isort
isort src/ tests/ examples/

# Check code style with flake8
flake8 src/ tests/ examples/

# Type checking with mypy (optional)
mypy src/
```

### Code Quality Checklist

- [ ] Code is formatted with Black
- [ ] Imports are sorted with isort
- [ ] No flake8 violations
- [ ] Type hints are added where appropriate
- [ ] Docstrings follow Google style
- [ ] Tests are added for new functionality
- [ ] Tests pass locally

## üìö Documentation

### Writing Documentation
